/* Iâ€™m interested in programming because I have a passion for tech, creativity, and finding solutions. I love the mental challenge that programming presents and the possibility of being able to conceive a new idea and bring it to fruition. My first exposure to programming was 8-9 years ago when I was taught the "Hello World!!" program in C. 
                            My interest overtime futher pushed me to  try teaching myself python to see if I could learn more difficult languages, and I was able to learn the basics. I have taken Computer Science as my major in my Under graduate. The projects I have done as a part of my academics proved to me that I would greatly benefit from learning programing techniques in a collaborative classroom setting.
                            I took a pause here and wanted to gain some industry experience to know what exactly is the industry looking for. I further realised the beauty of coding and programming and with the excitment of learning more I'm now enrolled in Master's degree majoring Computer Science at Oregon State University. */
